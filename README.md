# nibble
A simple web application that will generate random restaraunt reccomendations based on what a user does not want to eat.

--
USAGE
A user either allows location via their device, or they can manually enter a zip code or city. They can then choose foods
that they do not want to eat. The application then collects their choices, queries Yelp's API and returns a random restaraunt
based on their selections.
